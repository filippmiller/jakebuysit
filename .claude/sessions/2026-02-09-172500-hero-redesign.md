# Session Notes: Hero Section Redesign with Jack Photo & Animations

**Date:** 2026-02-09 17:25
**Area:** UI/Hero / Frontend
**Type:** feature
**Log Entry:** `.claude/agent-log.md` (entry at 2026-02-09 17:25)

## Context

User requested a redesigned hero section for the JakeBuysIt landing page. Requirements evolved through iterative feedback:
1. Initial: big Jake holding cash with a blob and "Show me whatcha got" headline
2. Added slogans: "we buy it all, computers, cell phones, technology, quick payout"
3. Replaced SVG with real jack.png photo
4. Added glassmorphism category cards
5. Restructured to 3-column with cards stacked in center
6. Added animated speech bubbles cycling through Jake quotes
7. Switched to jack1.png (clean cutout without built-in speech bubble)
8. Moved speech bubbles to right side of Jake (near his mouth)

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Initial Hero Creation
- Files: `web/components/HeroSection.tsx`, `web/app/globals.css`, `web/tailwind.config.ts`, `web/app/layout.tsx`
- Changes: Created full hero with SVG Jake, blob animation, headline, floating $ signs, ticker
- Reasoning: Starting from scratch with a distinctive dark western theme

### Phase 2: Switch to Real Photo
- Files: `web/components/HeroSection.tsx`, `web/public/jack.png`
- Changes: Replaced SVG with real jack.png, added 6 glassmorphism cards with Lucide icons
- Reasoning: User provided actual photo of Jake character

### Phase 3: Layout Restructure
- Files: `web/components/HeroSection.tsx`
- Changes: Moved from scattered card positions to 3-column grid (text | cards stack | Jake)
- Reasoning: User wanted cards "in one stack between WHATCHA and Jack"

### Phase 4: Speech Bubbles + jack1.png
- Files: `web/components/HeroSection.tsx`, `web/public/jack1.png`
- Changes: Added SpeechBubbles component, switched to jack1.png, positioned bubbles on right side
- Reasoning: User provided clean cutout photo and wanted animated speech bubbles near Jake's mouth

### Phase 5: Image Rendering Fix
- Files: `web/components/HeroSection.tsx`
- Changes: Switched from Next.js `<Image>` to regular `<img>` tag
- Reasoning: Next.js Image component failed to render the 3.2MB PNG (1024x1536) - image was invisible in DOM

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Regular `<img>` over Next.js `<Image>` | 3.2MB PNG wouldn't render with Image component | Could have optimized the image file size first |
| 3-column CSS grid | Clean separation of headline, cards, and photo | Flexbox with absolute positioning |
| AnimatePresence for speech bubbles | Smooth enter/exit transitions between messages | CSS-only transitions, no animation |
| Syne + Outfit fonts | Distinctive, bold display font for western theme | Inter (generic), Rye (too western/decorative) |
| useState/useEffect for cycling | Simple timer-based cycling every 4 seconds | Framer Motion variants, CSS animation |

## Files Changed (Full List)

## Commits

- `f01d1540` — feat(web): redesign hero with jack1.png, speech bubbles, and glass cards

## Gotchas & Notes for Future Agents

- **jack1.png is 3.2MB** — Do NOT switch back to Next.js `<Image>` component without testing. It silently fails to render this large PNG. The regular `<img>` tag works fine.
- **Speech bubbles position** — Currently at `absolute -right-4 top-[20%]` relative to Jake's container. If Jake's photo changes, bubble position needs adjustment.
- **Mobile layout** — Cards display in a 2x3 grid below Jake on mobile (`lg:hidden` section). Desktop uses vertical stack in center column.
- **Fonts** — Syne for display headlines (var --font-display), Outfit for body (var --font-sans). Defined in layout.tsx.
- **Next task** — User mentioned "we will need to fix next page after restart" — likely referring to the `/submit` page or another route that needs attention.
- **Dev server** — Was running on port 3002 during this session (3000 was occupied).
